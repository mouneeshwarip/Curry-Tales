## Objective
The idea for Curry Tales came from my love for South Indian cuisine, inspired by my family's rich food traditions. While I may not be the chef, I’ve always been surrounded by the vibrant flavors of South Indian dishes. This project is a tribute to my family, especially my mother, and aims to bring authentic South Indian grocery items and snacks to a wider audience. Created as part of my final project for the Code Institute Full Stack Software Developer course, this website showcases a piece of my heritage and passion for food.


### Site Users Goal
Site users can browse the website to explore a variety of South Indian grocery items and snacks, gain inspiration for their next meal. The site is designed for easy navigation, with a simple checkout process. Users can contact the admin for any questions or suggestions and subscribe to the Curry Tales newsletter to stay updated on new products, promotions, and sales. The About page offers insights into the site’s mission. Users can create profiles to save information for future purchases and track past orders, though profile creation is optional to make a purchase.



### Site Owners Goal
Besides providing a fully functional and welcoming E-commerce website, the admin can modify all important data either via frontend implementation, like adding, editing or deleting products, or through the admin panel, like changing the about page or editing categories. Any contact request will be send to the admin panel, providing important information like name and email. The admin can keep track of orders and collects payment info via [stripe](https://stripe.com) and collects the email addresses on [Mailchimp](https://www.mailchimp.com/) with the option to send out customized newsletters. More information about all [features](<#existing-features>) and the [future features](<#future-features>) are below.

## Business Model
Curry Tales is a Business to Consumer (B2C) e-commerce platform that offers South Indian groceries and snacks to a wide audience. The store features a variety of products, ranging from affordable everyday grocery items to premium specialty snacks for those seeking authentic South Indian flavors. We also offer curated collections for food lovers, including traditional spices, masala mixes, and unique snacks.

While providing a diverse range of South Indian food products, Curry Tales encourages users to interact with the site’s owners to ensure that the store continues to meet their needs. The philosophy behind Curry Tales is to be as customer-focused as possible, emphasizing excellent customer support. We prioritize building a smaller, loyal customer base rather than striving to become the largest online marketplace for groceries.
