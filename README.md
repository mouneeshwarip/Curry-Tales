# Project

Everything on this webpage is for educational purposes only, documentation on where pictures and information are coming from is in the credit section

## Objective
The idea for Curry Tales came from my love for South Indian cuisine, inspired by my family's rich food traditions. While I may not be the chef, I’ve always been surrounded by the vibrant flavors of South Indian dishes. This project is a tribute to my family, especially my mother, and aims to bring authentic South Indian grocery items and snacks to a wider audience. Created as part of my final project for the Code Institute Full Stack Software Developer course, this website showcases a piece of my heritage and passion for food.


### Site Users Goal
Site users can browse the website to explore a variety of South Indian grocery items and snacks, gain inspiration for their next meal. The site is designed for easy navigation, with a simple checkout process. Users can contact the admin for any questions or suggestions and subscribe to the Curry Tales newsletter to stay updated on new products, promotions, and sales. The About page offers insights into the site’s mission. Users can create profiles to save information for future purchases and track past orders, though profile creation is optional to make a purchase.



### Site Owners Goal
Besides providing a fully functional and welcoming E-commerce website, the admin can modify all important data either via frontend implementation, like adding, editing or deleting products, or through the admin panel, like changing the about page or editing categories. Any contact request will be send to the admin panel, providing important information like name and email. The admin can keep track of orders and collects payment info via [stripe](https://stripe.com) and collects the email addresses on [Mailchimp](https://www.mailchimp.com/) with the option to send out customized newsletters. More information about all [features](<#existing-features>) and the [future features](<#future-features>) are below.

## Business Model
Curry Tales is a Business to Consumer (B2C) e-commerce platform that offers South Indian groceries and snacks to a wide audience. The store features a variety of products, ranging from affordable everyday grocery items to premium specialty snacks for those seeking authentic South Indian flavors. We also offer curated collections for food lovers, including traditional spices, masala mixes, and unique snacks.

While providing a diverse range of South Indian food products, Curry Tales encourages users to interact with the site’s owners to ensure that the store continues to meet their needs. The philosophy behind Curry Tales is to be as customer-focused as possible, emphasizing excellent customer support. We prioritize building a smaller, loyal customer base rather than striving to become the largest online marketplace for groceries.

## Marketing Techniques
 After completing the challenges from the LMS, I’ve decided to focus on strong SEO and email marketing through newsletters as key objectives. If Curry Tales were a live e-commerce platform, I would start by promoting it on social media, running targeted ads on Facebook and Instagram, and collaborating with food influencers on platforms like TikTok and Instagram. For more details, see the final section of the marketing challenge below.

## About Facebook:

I own a private Facebook account (inactive), that I am refusing to reactivate because I do not want to agree to the current Meta terms and conditions. In the Code Institute LMS, we were provided with a Facebook mockup for balsamiq and got the information that if we do not wish to create a real facebook account, the mock ups are enough since ficticious business pages get closed very quickly anyway. Since I do not wish for Meta to have access to my personal data, nor do I see why a facebook page has anything to do with my coding capabilities, I decided to go with the mockup.

<details><summary><b>Facebook Criteria</b></summary>

* from the LMS "To be sure, to be sure" page:

![Facebook Criteria 1]()  <!-- Check some image here-->

* From the acceptance criteria:

![Facebook Criteria 2]() <!-- Check some image here-->

</details><br/>

While going over the acceptance criteria one last time, I saw that it is a must criteria to create the Facebook page. Since using my personal inactive Facebook account is out of the question, I decided to create a new account - which is at this time impossible for this project, since they will need to verify the account, which will take up to a day. Needless to say I did not upload my personal picture, nor did I add my actual information - so the chances that the account will not be autheticated are there as well. Therfore for this project, there will only be a mock up for the Facebook Business page.

## Project Management

### Github Board
For organizing and planning my project, I have used the [Github board]()<!--  github info here-->, which has helped me a lot with planning out and fulfilling the acceptance criteria. I have thoroughly kept the user stories up to date with the coding progress. Additionally, I have used multiple .txt files to keep up with ideas, documentation, my mentor meetings and bugs to implement in this documentation. 

<details><summary><b>Github Board</b></summary>

## Database Schema


The database schema was created with [BugBytes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzrE7cfc_3Q&t=478s) YouTube video and the corresponding tool [dreampuf](https://dreampuf.github.io/GraphvizOnline/). Due to certain reasons I could not completely follow my time plan, therefore I was unable to create a database schema myself, which was planned to be done with [Lucid](https://lucid.app/documents#/home?folder_id=recent). <!-- Check the above text on lucid etc... -->

* **Product** - Handles all products
* **Categories** - Handles all categories - connected to the item category
* **Order** - Handles all orders
* **OrderLineItem** - Handler between the products and a users order for checkout
* **Profile** - Handles the user profile information (full name, delivery information and order history for the specific user). There is a one-to-one relation to the user model to connect it to the standard user model.
* **About** - Handles the about information provided through the admin panel
* **Contact** - Handles all contact requests and sends them to the admin panel
* **All-Auth** - Various models included due to all-auth that handle users, email addresses and more

# User Experience (UX)

## Wireframes
The wireframes for the site were created in the software [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com). The wireframes have been created for desktop, tablet and mobile devices. The text content wasn't finalized during the wireframe process. Also I have decided to only focus on the user side since the admin frontend capabilities are less important for styling. For the Facebook mock up i have used the provided template from [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/)

## Site Structure

Curry Tales has been designed to allow any user to access all features without needing a profile (user profile and order history are the exceptions). Users can browse and place orders for various products, such as curries, snacks, and ready-to-eat meals. The website is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across all screen sizes, from mobile phones to desktop computers.

Upon entering the site, users are greeted with a welcoming header containing all the navigation elements, such as links to product categories, a search bar, and a shopping cart. The body of the homepage features an introductory message and a carousel showcasing featured products, with each image redirecting users to its corresponding product page. Users can also easily navigate to the product detail pages for more in-depth information about each dish or snack, including ingredients, preparation, and nutritional info.

The "About Us" page offers background on the Curry Tales brand, while the "Contact Us"  page provides essential customer service information.

For the admin side, there are advanced front-end admin capabilities, such as adding, editing, or deleting products (dishes, snacks, or ingredients), managing categories, updating product information, and handling customer queries via the admin panel. Admins (superusers) can directly access and manage these features via a special admin button, ensuring smooth management of the website's content and functionality.

## Design Choices

### Color Scheme
The color scheme for Curry Tales was carefully chosen to reflect the rich, vibrant colors found in South Indian cuisine. The primary color palette is inspired by warm, earthy tones like turmeric yellows, masala reds, and curry greens, which evoke the spices and flavors of traditional South Indian cooking. Accent colors are drawn from the natural hues of rice, coconut milk, and rustic clay, creating an inviting, authentic feel. This color palette complements the branding and theme of the website, enhancing the user experience while also emphasizing the warmth and homeliness of South Indian food.

[Coolors](https://coolors.co/) was used to create the color palette:

<details><summary><b>Color Palette</b></summary>

</details><br/>

### Typography
The fonts used for the site are 'Lato'. 

'Lato' is used on the whole webpage. Choosing this font family was because I thought it would fit the theme.
