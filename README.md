Because my laptop, on which I had worked on most of my project, broke down, I lost the entire README.md file as it was not pushed to GitHub in time. The transition from my original Windows laptop to a Mac not only caused me to encounter problems with the operating system, but I also lost documents and had issues with my database. Thanks to tutor support, I was able to salvage most parts of my project. Unfortunately, the documentation is missing at the moment.
